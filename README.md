# Read-Me-First

During my career, I primarily worked with private GitHub and Bitbucket repositories under enterprise accounts. As a result, my public GitHub activity might appear limited, even though I have been actively working as a developer since 2017.

To showcase my skills and experience, I’ve included links to my pet projects below, which I believe are worth your attention:

* [Circle](https://github.com/circles-project/circles-ios) - Real-world project where I was an integral part of the iOS development team, contributing to its functionality and user experience.

* [Leedcode](https://github.com/RyshchukDmytro/Leetcode) - A collection of problems I’ve solved on LeetCode. I add new solutions from time to time to demonstrate problem-solving skills and algorithm expertise.

* [Answers](https://github.com/RyshchukDmytro/Answers) - A 5-hour assessment project showcasing my design and implementation skills using SwiftUI.

* [Morse](https://github.com/RyshchukDmytro/Morse) - Project in progress: an app for encoding/decoding Morse code, complete with sound playback and light flashing functionality.

Feel free to explore these projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like more details about my professional work!
